# dictionaryAPI

This vanilla JavaScript project, complemented with Bootstrap for a simple interface, powers a basic web app. It waits for the webpage to load, then enables users to search for word definitions. After entering a word, users can click a button or press Enter to fetch and display the definitions from an online dictionary API. Errors are handled with alerts. A clear button resets the search.
